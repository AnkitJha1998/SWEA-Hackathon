# SWEA-Hackathon
### Idea:

Our Idea is to develop a system that can provide security with energy conservation using IoT.
This project doesn't aim a any individual but at a community as a whole.
What we are trying to implement is that no outsider would be allowed to enter the society/community during odd hours like at night.
For that we have made a system where any person who wishes to enter the during that time has to go through automated security checkup.
First strp is to provide Secure pass id that only members of community have and is also unique to individual houses.
If he doesnt wish to provide the id or if he forgets the id then we have given another option of face recognition.
If security checkup fails the alarm goes off notifying the secretary or any other person about intruder entering the society.
Then comes the IoT part here the lighting system in the whole community is sesor controlled , ie it is controlled by the proximity of the person to the light.
